This is an mobile version of DDCToolbox with limited functionality.
It is designed to provide an user-friendly and easy-to-understand interface, in order to allow even less-experienced users to experiment with the DDC feature included in JamesDSP and Viper4Android.

Of course, I couldn't include every feature found in the [desktop version](https://github.com/ThePBone/DDCToolbox).

**Following features are excluded from the Android version** (for now):
  * Import AutoEQ and (classic) VDC files
  * Editing/adding custom filters (you can still remove and inspect them)
  
### Where can I get an APK?
There isn't a release yet, so you'll have to compile it by yourself.
I'm hoping to get a Google Play Dev Account to publish it on the Play Store soon.
